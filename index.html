        <h1> Retribution (Python partner project) </h1>
        <h2> This is a short (currently unfinished) text-based adventure RPG where you earn your freedom by defeating a monster. </h2>
        <p> Nick and I started this project with a grand vision in our heads of a fully-fledged game with inventory, exploration, multiple choices, character interaction, and many monsters. </p>
        <p> However, we quickly realized that we wouldn't have time to do all of this, so we decided upon the condensed version. </p>
        <p> The hardest thing for this project was the battle system, which took a while to complete (and is still not finished). </p>
